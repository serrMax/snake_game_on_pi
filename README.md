# Snake game on raspberry pi and unicorn HAT with 7 segment LED
<br><br>
![setup](/setup_photo.jpg)
<br><br>
4 buttons, 1 unicorn HAT (8x8 LED matrix), 1 raspberry pi, 1 7-segment LED, bunch of wires, some free time and not so creative mind is all you need for this one! If you are reading this, I guess you already have the latter two, so just buy the remaining ones and have some fun xD

P.S. 7 segment LED is used for displaying the level the player is on (3-7). It starts with 3 because level = number of snake body pixels.
